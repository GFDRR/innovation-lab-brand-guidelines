There are 4 main structural elements in the InnovationLab sites: Navigation bar, filters bar, map, content, related content, and footer. Some of them form part of the base structure, others are optional.

### Homepage

The homepage consists of the navigation and filters bar, at the top of the page, a content block and a footer at the bottom.

### Project Pages
Each project page shares similar structure. Again there is a navigation and filters bar at the top of the page, followed by a map section (showing where the project is taking place), a content section and the footer at the bottom.

### Resources and news pages

Resource and news pages have just a navigation bar at the top, followed by a map block, the main content of the page, a related content bar and a footer at the bottom.

### Detail Page

Each detail page has the same structure as a resource and news page: navigation bar, map block, content block, related content bar and footer.
