In addition to the structural elements there are a number of common elements that can be used across the site. An example of this would be:

<div class="c-image">
  <img src="/innovation-lab-brand-guidelines/images/02-website/02-02-common-elements/2-6-a.png" alt="2-6-a.png">
</div>

<ol class="c-list -alphabetic">
  <li>Navigation bar</li>
  <li>Banners of highlighted content</li>
  <li>Cards grid</li>
</ol>

The mixture of an appealing picture, distinctive call to action and basic contextual information should entice users to navigate to the new page. They can be found as part of almost every page.
