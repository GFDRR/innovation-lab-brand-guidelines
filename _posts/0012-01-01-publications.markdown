There are two options for publication front covers:

<div class="c-image">
  <img src="/innovation-lab-brand-guidelines/images/03-communication-materiale/03-01-publications/.png" alt=".png">
</div>

The first has a mostly white background with title placed under a cover image and above the Open DRI logo. The second option has a full A4 cover photo with the title and logo placed within a white text box over the top of the picture.
