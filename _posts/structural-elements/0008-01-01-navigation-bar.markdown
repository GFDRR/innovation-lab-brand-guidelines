The navigation bar is found at the top of every page: it is a universal feature on the site. It helps users find the main areas of content on the site (projects, resources, about us, news, etc).

</div>

The bar is responsive to the size of the browser window. On larger windows the full Open DRI logo (87 px height) will be shown with the menu options below it (78px height).

On smaller screens a shortened version of the logo is shown (without the full Open Data for Resilience Initiative text) with the menu options to the right. They all sit within a bar 78 pixels high.
