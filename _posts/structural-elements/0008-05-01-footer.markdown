The footer is another universal part of the site: it is on every page. It helps people sign up for the newsletter or navigate to other parts of the site after finishing a page.

<div class="c-image">

</div>

The footer is 270px high, its background responds to the width of the window, and its content are inline with the rest of the content in the site.
